IF-C01COMG Clone board SMD Full size_SCART-VGA15kHz

This is a full sized version of the IF-C01COMG board for JVC pro monitors (TM-Hxx50CG) and some others...

It's basically the THT base board I made some months ago, with most components changed to SMD.

Credit goes to James Vanderloeff for the dual input idea.

Board is for now completely untested...

Finally this is a Kicad 5.1 project :D
